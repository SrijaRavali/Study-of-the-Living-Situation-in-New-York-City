# Study-of-the-Living-Situation-in-New-York-City
Analyze factors influencing living situations in NYC, including housing costs, employment prospects, and crime rates, to provide valuable insights for residents, investors, and policymakers. Methodology: Utilized Knowledge Discovery in Database (KDD) method with Python for data processing, MongoDB for initial data storage, and PostgreSQL for data analysis. Included data sanitization, transformation, normalization, and visualization techniques.

Technical Aspects:

Data Selection: Curated relevant datasets for analysis.
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and transformed data for storage.
Database Management: Utilized MongoDB for JSON data and transitioned to PostgreSQL post-cleansing.
Data Analysis: Applied normalization techniques for optimized data structure.
Visualization: Created insightful visualizations to interpret results effectively.
Key Findings:

Manhattan emerged with the most job prospects and safest environment.
Queens stood out for high property values and moderate crime rates, making it an attractive destination for property seekers.
Conclusion: By leveraging Python, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL, the project successfully extracted meaningful insights into NYC's living situations, aiding stakeholders in informed decision-making.Objective: Analyze factors influencing living situations in NYC, including housing costs, employment prospects, and crime rates, to provide valuable insights for residents, investors, and policymakers.
